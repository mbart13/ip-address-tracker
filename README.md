## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

- LeafletJS for generating map

- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow


In this project I tried to organize folder structure a little better, but still I'm not sure if this is correct as there are so many approaches in react projects.
Initially I wanted to use react-leaflet library for map generation, but it didn't work as I expected, so next time it would be better to read documentation first.
